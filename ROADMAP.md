## Roadmap

-   [x] Basic chained calls.

-   [ ] Advanced chained calls for collections.

-   [ ] Async transformations.

-   [ ] Typed errors.

-   [ ] Marshalling transformations instead of serialization. Do not change or create a new object if it's instance.

-   [ ] Collect data errors during serialization instead of throwing only first one.

-   [ ] Test coverage 100%.
